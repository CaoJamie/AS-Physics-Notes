# Definition
## Wave
* > Pattern of disturbances [1] which transport energy but does not transport matter[1]
* a wave have pattern of disturbances as the particles are ocillating 
* how to draw a wave moving in the right direction
    * parallel move the wave
    * draw parallel for the coincidence point
    * notice for crust they are at the point about to move
* the particles of waves could be particles at field

## Amplitude, Wavelength, Frequency, Period
* > Amplitude(A) is the maximum displacement from __equillibrium position__ of the wave
* > Wavelength($\lambda$) is the distance between two consecutive disturbances 
* > Frequency(f) is the number of waves made in second[Hz] = [$s^{-1}$]
* > Period(T) is the time for a wave to made a complete ocillation
* $T = \frac{1}{f} \Longleftrightarrow f = \frac{1}{T}$

## Doppler effect
* > the __apparent__ change[1] in frequency for the __observer__[1] if there is __relative motion__ between observer and source[1]
* $$f_o = \frac{f_Sv}{v\pm v_S}$$
* the wavelength get smaller && frequency get bigger for source moving toward observer
* the wavelength get bigger && frequency get smaller for source moving away from observer

## Longitudinal/Transverse wave
* Longitudinal
    * >Longitudinal wave are the wave that the particles of the wave vibrate along the direction of propagation of the wave
    * compression(the closest part of particles)/rerafraction(between compression)
    * $\lambda$ = distance between two consecutive compression
    * $A$ = half distance ocillate by the point at compression 
    *  $T$ = time taken for the particles to vibrate one ocillation
    *  example: P wave, slinky spring, sound wave
* Transverse
    * >Transverse wave are the wave that the particles of the wave vibrate perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave
    * direction of propgation of wave is the direction where the energy is transfer
    * wave front(birds eye view of wave) and the direction of propagation are always perpendicular
    * Example: electromagenetic wave, S wave, ocean wave

## Intensity
* >Intensity is the energy per time per area
* $I = \frac{\frac{E}{t}}{A} = \frac{E}{At} = \frac{P}{A}$
* Factor affecting Intensity
    * For 3D situation, $I = \frac{P}{4\pi R^2} \Rightarrow I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
    * $I \propto A^2 \Rightarrow I = kA^2$

## Standing Wave
* >Standing Wave is the result of superposition of a progressive wave and its relection travelling in opposite direction at certain frequency
* nodes: the place where the particle of standing wave doesn't vibrate
* antinodes: the place where the particle of standing wave are vibrate at maximum distance
* frequency at which the standing waves are form is called harmonics
    * $f_0$ Fundamental harmonic/first harmonic
    * 2$f_0$ second harmonic
    * etc.
* $\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$(for fundamental frequency, the Length is half the wavelength)
* change in position for the wave is calculate by T and then deduce to shift up or down
* open end tube && closed end tube
    * open end: $L = \frac{1}{2}L$
    * close end: $L = \frac{1}{4}L$, end correction(c) may be found by changing the length of the tube
# Concept
## Wave Equation
* $v = \lambda f$
* Derivation:
    * $$v = \frac{s}{t} = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \lambda \frac{1}{T} = \lambda f$$

## Phase difference
* Phase differnce is an angle/relationship
    * simple harmonic motion can be related to a wave if projected in time, and then the phase difference can be related from points between waves
    * thus we would obtain $\phi = \frac{\pi}{2} rad = 90^o = \frac{\lambda}{n} m$
* Progressive Wave
    * In phase: $\phi = 2k\pi = k\lambda (k\in N)$
    * Anti phase: $\phi = (2k+1)pi = \frac{2k+1}{2}\lambda(k \in N)$
    * $\phi = \frac{2\pi}{T}t$ where t = difference between two points
* Standing wave
    * two consecutive point:0
    * between opposite point:$\pi$
    * between diagnoal point:$\pi$

## Principal of Superposition
* >when two or more wave comes together, the displacement of corespond wave is the __Algebraic Sum__ for the displacement of the waves
* > Interference is the superposistiuon of two coherent sources(pitcture doesn't change)
* >Coherent source are the source that the phase difference between waves in time are constant
    * Constructive Superposisiton: $\Delta d = n\lambda (n\in N)$ (maxima)
    * Destructive Superposistion: $\Delta d = \frac{n+1}{2} \lambda (n\in N)$ (minima - they are between two maxima)
* $\Delta d$ are the path difference, which is the difference in wavelength between two waves

## Double slit experiment
* one light source to a monochromatic filter with single slit follow by a double slit and a screen
* $\lambda = \frac{ax}{D}$ where a is the slit seperation, x is the fringe seperation, D is the distance between double slit and light screen
* Derivation:
    * Path difference between the waves from two slit to $1^o$ maxima is $\lambda$
    * It would then obtain$sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a}$
    * Obtain another triangle between distance from cetnre between slits to $0^o$ maxima and to $1^o$ maxima (isolecese if $D \ggg big$)
    * $\theta _1 \simeq \theta _2$ as both are small
    * therefore $\sin \theta_1 \simeq \tan \theta_2 \Rightarrow \frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{x}{D} \Rightarrow \lambda = \frac{ax}{D}$
* This is the only ways to calculate the wavelength of light
* Diffracting grating:
    * $d\sin \theta = n\lambda(n \in N)$, derivation comes from the double slit experiment if change the $\lambda$ to different maxima and a to d(grating spacing)
* Changes to the effect with different effect:
    * close one slit - no pattern of diffraction and dimmer
    * narrw the slit - dimmer but pattern still there
    * different light source is used - fringe sepreation change because $\lambda$ change

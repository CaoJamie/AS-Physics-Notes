# Definition of Concept

## Work done

* Work done by a force is defined as the product of the forrce and the distance moved __in the direction__of the force
* $W = F*s$
* Work is a scalar(result of dot product)

## Power

* power is the rate of energy transform

## Energy

* Energy is the ability to conduct work

## Kinetics Energy

* Kinetic energy is the energy of mass has due to motion

## Gravatitional potential energy

* Gravational energy is the energy 

## elastic potential energy



## efficiency

* $\eta = \frac{Useful}{Total}$
* it could be power/energy/heat

## conservation of energy

* energy can not be created or destroyed. It can only be converted from one form to another.
* The only exception is __Nuclear Reaction__
* The energy comes from __Big Bang__

# Definition of Unit

## Joule

* $J = Nm$
* Joule is such amount of work done when a force of 1 N moves a distance of 1 metre($1J = 1N/1m$)

## Watts

* $W = \frac{J}{s}$
* 1 watt is such amount of power when an energy of 1J is exerted in 1 second($1W = 1J/1s$)

# Derivation

## GPE

* $GPE = mgh$
* plug in $F = W = mg$ and change $s$ to $h$

## EPE

* $EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$
* Derivation based on the graph of force-extension
* $Work done = Area under the graph$
* $Area = \frac{1}{2}Fx$
* Plug in Hooke's law$F = kx$

## KE

* $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
* Derivation based on $v^2 - u^2 = 2as$
* take the inital velocity as 0, obtain $v^2= 2as$
* multiple both side $\frac{1}{2}m$ gives $\frac{1}{2}mV^2 = $

## Power via speed

* $P = F*v$
* Derivation based on definition of power $P = \frac{W}{t}$ into $P = \frac{F*s}{t}$
* taken $\frac{s}{t}$ as $v$
* Notice the force could only be driving force, not a resultant force(Must be constant speed)

## Work done by gas

* $W = p \Delta V$
* Notice the $\Delta V$ is a must
* Using proof from unit $W = pv = [Pa*m^3] = [\frac{N}{m^2}*m^3] = [Nm] = [J]$

# Other Concept

## Sankey Diagram

* It can gives the effeciency of the apparatus
* If no number shown, measure the length and give the scale of the effeciency

# Definition

## Electric Field
* Field is an area where an object experienced force
* >Electric field is the field where a _stationary_ charge experienced force
* Gravitational field is the field where an mass experienced force

## Electric field strength
* $E = \frac{F}{Q}$
* >Force per __unit__ positive charge/charge __placed into field__
* This is a scaler when the definition gives postive charge in the field, and is a vector when no specific charge is given
* The charge must be the charge placed into field
* Unit: $N/C = Kgms^{-2}/As = KgA^{-1}ms^{-3}$
* In Uniform field __ONLY__ $E = -\frac{V}{d}$, minus sign must be shown, alternative unit is $V/m$

## Uniform Field
* >Electric Field strength is same in every point
* Parallel line with same distance(Electric Field Strength), so when shown distance must be same
* When a charged particle moves right angle with in it, it can be modeled as a projectile motion

## Non-Uniform Field
* >Electric field strength is not the same in every point
* distance between field line changes

## Current
* >As phenomenon: Directed motion of Charges
* >As variable: Rate of flow of Charges
* $I = \frac{Q}{t}$
* real direction of current: from negative to postive
* Conventional direction of current: from postive to negative
* In a conductor

## Voltage
* $V = \frac{E}{Q}$
* >Energy per unit charge
* Unit: $J/C = Nm/C = Kgms^{-2}m/As = Kgm^2A^{-1}s^{-3}$
* $p.d. = \frac{E}{Q}$ 
* >Energy converted from electric to other form to move the charge per unit charge
* $ε =\frac{E}{Q}$
* > Energy converted from other form to electric to move the charge  in a complete circuit per unit charge
* > 1 Volt is such a voltage that use 1J of energy to move 1C of charge
* Across a component

## Resistance
* $R = \frac{V}{I}$
* >Resistance is the ratio of voltage over current
* unit: $\Omega = Kgm^2A^{-2}s^{-3}$
* actually it is a properties of materials and is not affect by voltage and current
* Actual formula: $R=\rho \frac{L}{A}$
* of a conductor

## Power
* >Power is rate of energy transfer ($P = \frac{E}{t}$)
* $P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{VQ}{t}$
* $P = IV = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}$
* for one variable resistance when internal resistance appeared: the internal resistance must be the same resistance to the variable resistance to have the maximum power in external resistor

## Electric Energy
* >Power per unit time
* $P =\frac{E}{t}t = IVt = I^2Rt = \frac{V^2}{R}t$

# Concept

## Electric field line
* Arrows from Postive(+) to Negative(-)[1]
* Must touch with both plate/object[1]
* Minimum 4 line must shown[1]
* In uniform field distance must be same(1)
* In non-uniform field distance must change(1)
* The electric field line direction indicate the charge on both side and thus provide indication when a particles moves in it require identification(+ attracts - and vice versa)

## Charge is quantised
* Charge is discreate
* All the charge must be a whole number of charge of fundamental charge
* $e = 1.6*10^{-19}C$

## DC and AC
* DC(direct current):  Charges (electrons in metals and ions in electrolytes)
* AC(alternative current): Electrion move backward and forward 

## Measuring EMF(ε) and internal resistor
1. connect the circuit with variable resistance
* read the terminal p.d. and I
* Plot the graph of V to I and change the variable resistor
* $ε = IR(terminal\space  p.d.) + Ir(lost\space volts)$
* if R decrease, then I increase, Ir increase and IR decrease because ε is the same
* $ε = V + Ir \Rightarrow V = -Ir +ε$
2. Use Potential meter
* Read from sensitive gaivanometer when moving jockey on potentiometer wire and measure AY(read from meter ruler) where it is 0
* $E_X = \frac{AY}{AB}*E_0$
* or you can compare the $E_X \& E_y$

## Kirchhoff's Law
* >$1^{st}$Kirchhoff's law: total current into junction into total current out of junction
* >$2^{nd}$Kirchhoff's law: the sum of IR = ε

## Ammeter's and Voltmeter's resistances
* Ammeter's resistance as small as possible
* Votlmeter's resistance as large as possible
# Derivation

## Drift Velocity
* $I = nqVA = nAve$ (naive without I)
* n = charge density = $\frac{N}{V}$ Unit: $m^{-3}$
* Derivation: $I = \frac{Q}{t}(definition) = \frac{Ne}{t} = \frac{nVe}{t} = \frac{nALe}{t} = nAve$
* $V \propto I$ and $V \propto \frac{1}{A}$

## Potential Divider
* $V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}*V_{in}$
* step 1: $I = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1 + R_2}$
* step 2: $V_{out} = I*R_2 = \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}*V_{in}$
* they are used in direct sensing devices

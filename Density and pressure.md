# Definition

## Density

* > Mass per unit volume
* $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$
* $\frac{kg}{m^3} = \frac{10^3g}{10^6cm^3}=10^{-3}\frac{g}{cm^3}$

## Pressure

* > Force per unit area
* $P = \frac{F}{A}$
* Pressure is a scalar because of __Pascal Law__: Pressure is the same in all direction, therefore pressure is a vector acting everywhere, which is no direction(this caused the up thrust)
* Solid: Weight or Force exerted on the surface of solid $P = \frac{F}{A}$
* Liquid:  up thrust create against weight $P = \frac{F}{A}$ or $P = \rho gh$
* Gasses: gas molecule _move_ and _collide_ with the surface and the _change in momentum_ exerted force on the surface to create pressure $P = \frac{F}{A}$ 

# Concept

## Pressure transmission

* Pressure is the same in everywhere of the container

* Force does NOT transmitted

* $\frac{F_1}{A_1} = \frac{F_2}{A_2}$

* This is applicable for all substance

* - For Liquid it is Hydraulic

  - For Gas it is Pneumatics

  - It is also possible with solid



# Derivation

## Obtain pressure formula in Liquid

* $P = \rho gh$ from $P = \frac{F}{A}$
* $P = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{mg}{A} = \rho \frac{V}{A}g = \rho \frac{Ah}{A}g = \rho gh$  
* Area does NOT affect the pressure
* For U shape Tube: $Pressure_{Left} = Pressure_{Right}$ , therefore it is atmospheric pressure + $\rho gh$ in open tube case, and lower(because of one side does not have atmospheric pressure) if one end is closed. 
* The U shape tube connected with a funnel is how the __manometer__ made

## Work done by Gases

* $W = p \Delta V$
* Derivation Comes from unit: $[pV] = Nm = J$

# Definition

## Tensile forces and Compressive forces

* Tensile force is the resistance to the extended of the original length
* Compressive force is the resistance to the compression of the original length

## Hooke's Law

* $F = kx$
* Distinguish between IV and DV of the graph (Both are correct) of F-x and x-F graph
* X axis is independent(the variable you __change__) and Y axis is dependent(the variable you __measure__) variable, and you should be aware of the axis with the correct neuances
* $k$ is spring constant, or _stiffness_

## Spring Combination

* Use Analogy with resister(parallel/Series)
* Parallel:$k_{total} = k_1 + k_2$ (series resister)
* Series:$k_{total} = \frac{k_1 *k_2}{k_1 + k_2}$ (parallel resister)
* Combination: using the similar techiques in resister

## Stress and Strain + Young's Module

* Stress: $\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$ (Closness to breaking), unit $Pa$
* Strain: $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}$, no unit or in %
* Young's Module: $\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}$ is constant for the same material(ration remain the same)
* It can be also expressed in $\frac{FL}{A\Delta L}$
* Young's Moduls is __not the property of the object__, but the __property of the material making the object__

## Limit of elasticity

* Limit of propotionality is the maximum possiple point where the line is still straight(allow to apply Hooke's law) - Last point of the straight line
* Limit of elasticity in 99% conicide with limit of propotionality, but for some material it can shrink back to the original size even after this point, then it is __always beyond__ the limit of propotionality - Last point where the spring shurnk back to original size
* If the Spring does not shrink back to the original size and exceeds the original size, the area between the curve is the energy use to extend the spring/energy left in the spring

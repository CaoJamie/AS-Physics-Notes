# Definition

## Atoms. molecules, ions and isotpoes
* > Atoms: smallest neutral particlesw of substance made up of
* >Molecule: 2 or more atom chemically bond together
* >Ions: atoms loosed(Postive ion) or gained(negative ion) electrions
* >Isotopes: the __nucleus__ of atom that have same number of proton but different number of neutron

## Radioactive Decay
* > Nuclei crack/split emmitting $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ particles, making a more stable element
*  Sub-atomic particles

## Classifying Particles
* Particles
    * Fundamental/Elementary (not made from smaller):
        * Leptons
            * $e^-$
            * $e^+$
            * $V_e$ and $\overline{V_e}$ 
            * $V_{\mu}$ and $\overline {V_{\mu}}$
        * Quarks
            * u($+\frac{2}{3}e$)
            * d($-\frac{1}{3}e$)
            * s($-\frac{1}{3}e$)
    * Non-Fundamental/Hardons (made from quarks):
        * Barons(3 quarks)
            * $p = uud$
            * $n = udd$
        * Mesons(2 quarks)
            * Kaons(one contains $s$ or $\bar s$)
                * $k_0$
                * $k_+$
                * $k_-$
            * Pions(do not contain $s$ or $\bar s$)
                * $\pi _0$
                * $\pi _+$
                * $\pi _-$

# Concept

## Rutherford Experiment
* Proof Plam pudding model is wrong(by J.J.Thompson)
    * Atom is made of postively charged with the negative charged stick as pudding plams
* Prapose planetary model
    * Nucleus is highly condensed matter of postive charged and electron ciraling around the nucleus as planet
* Preparation
    * Box of lead specific to one direction
    * a substance of radioactive placed inside
    * 2-3 atom thickness thin gold foil
    * Placed in vacum chamber prevent $\alpha$ particles to collide with air particles 
    * Similar reason must keep in darkness
    * G.M. tube connect to the counter around the foil in all direction
* Result
    * 98% are directly pass trhough --> big distance between nucleus and electron
    * Few are bent in small angle --> nucleuas is postivly charged
    * very few bent in large angle --> nucleuas is postivly charged and concentrate the mass

## Equation and diagrams of decay
* $\sum atomic \space number$ and $\sum mass \space number$ stays __constnat__

## Conservation
* Mass AND energy conserved all together
* Momeuntum conserved
* Nuceloni number conserved(proton number don't conserved)
* Mass number conserved(mass don't conserved)
* charge conserved

## Strong force and Weak force
* Strong force control hardron and quarks: hold nuclear together and responsible for $\alpha$ decay
* Weak force control leptons: responsible for $\beta$ decay
